# AI-Code-Generation

This proof of concept (POC) demonstrates AI-assisted unit test generation using four different approaches. It aims to explore methods to improve unit test generation.

Apart from these 4 approaches, we can also use Reinforcement Learning using Human Feedback and Improving the Test Cases by Introducing Mutations in the Source Code.


## Instructions to Run the POC
1. Upload projects.zip: Ensure the projects.zip file is uploaded to your Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Set OpenAI API Key: Provide your OpenAI API key for generating test cases.
